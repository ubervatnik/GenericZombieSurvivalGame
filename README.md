# GenericZombieSurvivalGame 
GZSG is a text based survival game where you must navigate in a world overrun by zombies.

Build defenses, kill zombies, protect survivors.

GZSG also features an world where you can remove and place blocks to create fortifications against zombies.

- **Enemies (Zombies)**: Represented by `Z`. Avoid or shoot them to survive.
- **Survivors**: Represented by `S`. They are neutral entities in the game. I will improve them in next updates.

> [!NOTE]
> As you see, there's not much entities, survivors don't move, its because the game is not finished yet. I will improve those and add more things in the future.
