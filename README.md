# GenericZombieSurvivalGame 
GZSG is a text based survival game where you must navigate in a world overrun by zombies.

Build defenses, kill zombies, protect survivors.

GZSG also features an world where you can remove and place blocks to create fortifications against zombies.


## Gameplay Mechanics

- **Move Player**: Use the following keys to move:
  - `w`: Move up
  - `a`: Move left
  - `s`: Move down
  - `d`: Move right

- **Place Block**: Press `p` to place a solid block (`█`) at the your current position.

- **Remove Block**: Press `r` to remove the block at your current position and add it to your inventory.

- **Shoot Zombie**: Press `f` to shoot in a specified direction (select with w/a/s/d).

- **Quit Game**: Press `q` to quit the game.

## Inventory

- **Solid Blocks (`█`)**: The number of solid blocks available in your inventory.

## Entities

- **Enemies (Zombies)**: Represented by `Z`. Avoid or shoot them to survive.
- **Survivors**: Represented by `S`. They are neutral entities in the game. I will improve them in next updates.

> [!NOTE]
> As you see, there's not much entities, survivors don't move, its because the game is not finished yet. I will improve those and add more things in the future.
